                For eg, after successfully entering the correct OTP and being redirected to the login screen, users are asked to log in with their phone no. and password. 
                This highlights that the previously provided email is not used throughout the authentication process, raising concerns about 
                its purpose and effectiveness in the registration process. This discrepancy can be considered a red flag.

                <ul>I thought that maybe the email and password that I entered in register page of <span class="colord">app</span> may work. 
                  I entered the email and password but not get logged in this <span class="colord">partners</span> subdomain. <b>Maybe this an be the reason that our account was not fully created/verified in <span class="colord">app</span> subdomain

              <BR>
              <ul><span class="colorb">Important</span> <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> It seems that in the <span class="colord">app</span> subdomain, the phone 
                no. is the primary method for authentication, while the <span class="colord">partners</span> subdomain relies mainly on email. </b></ul>
              <ul>I thought maybe the email that was useless in <span class="colord">app</span> subdomain get used in this subdomain to get authenticated. 
                But how that's possible because there was no register page and only login page (means only authenticated users were allowed) and our account was 
                not fully created/verified in previous subdomain so our email not get stored in database and can't be used as already existing or authenticated user.
              </ul>
      
            </ul> 
            <br>      
            <ul id="flaw"><span class="colora">Understanding</span> <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> Now, let me make it clear that It was not possible to somehow bypass login/register page of <span class="colord">app</span> sub. So, I 
              shifted my attention to <span class="colord">partners</span> sub to somehow find a flaw and get into that subdomain without fully getting registered in <span class="colord">app</span> sub and also not providing credentials for already existing user as I was not having that. <br>
            Cause there was use of email in this subdomain so maybe it can be somewhat possible to find a broken logic into this or previous subdomain to access this <span class="colord">partners</span> subdomain. </ul>

            <br>
            <h3 class="headerc">3. <span>Discovery of Broken Logic</span></h3>
            <ul>&#x2022; Now, Behaviors about these two subdomain would be much clear to you. This section is the core part 
              of this Article so If you still don't understand the working of subdomains so again read above sections.</ul>
            <br>
            <h3 class="headerd">1. <span>app.danacita.co.id subdomain</span></h3>
            <ul>
              <br>
              &#x2022 Register Page: https://app.danacita.co.id/register
              <ul>&#x2022 I entered email, phone no. and password in this page and get into OTP screen. You know its important to enter correct OTP 
                to get into account and there was no use of email in this subdomain.
              <br>
              I think that when I entered the email, phone and password and get redirected to OTP screen then our half registration is completed. Right? So, maybe website has stored 
              our all details (email, phone & password) or few details (email & password) in its DATABASE, when we get redirected to OTP screen.
              </ul>
              <br>
              &#x2022 Login Page: https://app.danacita.co.id/login
              <ul>&#x2022 There was option for phone and password to get logged in and no use of email. I was stuck till OTP screen only.</ul>
              As I told you that maybe all the details (email, phone and password) was stored on DB when I get on OTP screen. To test this I went to login page when 
              I get redirected to OTP screen without entering correct OTP by assumption that maybe my details get stored in DB when half registration is completed. 
              In login page I entered phone and password without fully creating account and LOL I was not successful! Hmm...Still I was having hope that maybe my email get stored in DB if phone and password 
              is not stored.
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul><span class="colorb">Keep In Mind</span> <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> How I can test that email is stored or not in DB when our half registration is completed 
                (means we get on OTP screen), cause there was no option to enter email in this subdomain login page. So, I think that partners.danacita.co.id was having email option 
              in login page.</b></ul>
        </ul>
              
              <br>

              <br>
              &#x2022 Login Page: https://partners.danacita.co.id/login
              <ul>&#x2022 So, I suspected that the DB of both subdomains might be connected, so I tested if my email was stored before fully creating account and after getting redirected to OTP screen. 
                I tried logging in to <span class="colord">partners</span> with the email and password I used on the registration page of 
                <span class="colord">app</span> sub, assuming my email might have been stored even if my phone number wasn't. 
                This was my last hope for accessing the partners subdomain.
                <br>
                Still I wasn't able to access the <span class="colord">partners</span> subdomain with the email and password, I decided to give it one last try using the 
                "Forgot Password" page on this subdomain.
              </ul>
              <br>

              <br>
              &#x2022 Forgot Password Page: https://partners.danacita.co.id/forgot_password
              <ul>&#x2022 So, I entered the email here also to check whether my email is really stored in DB or not.
                <br>
                Boom!!! I received a password reset token on my that email and I was able to reset password and get into <span class="colord">partners</span> subdomain without fully creating an account on <span class="colord">app</span> subdomain and also by not providing 
                credentials (email & password) of already existing user in <span class="colord">partners</span> subdomain.
              </ul>
              <BR>
              <ul><span class="colorb">Important</span> <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> It turns out that my assumption was correct. The email was stored in 
                the DB when I was redirected to the OTP screen (means half registration/verification is completed), and it appears that the databases of both subdomains are connected or the same. 
                This allowed me to use the "Forgot Password" page on the partners subdomain to confirm that my email was indeed stored.</b></ul>

          <h3 class="headerc">5. <span>Reasons - Why this happened ?</span></h3>
          <ul>There were mainly three reasons for happening of this very cool vulnerability:
            <br>
            &#x2022 The website was storing our details (email) into there DB even when our account is not fully created. It was storing email into DB when we redirected to 
            OTP screen. But, The system didn't fully validate or clear partially entered data, leading to discrepancies 
            between the subdomains in how user details are handled and stored.
          <br>
          <BR>
          &#x2022 Databases of both the subdomains are connected. This is not a bad approach to connect DB or use same DB for multiple subdomains. But, 
          as our email of app.danacita.co.id was stored in that DB before fully creation of account and If we ask for password reset 
          of that email so partners.danacita.co.id check that whether this is stored or not. Due to this flaw it get stored and it think this user already exists and send 
          us a password reset token to get into the account.
          <br>
          <br>
          &#x2022 The partners subdomain relied on email for authentication, while the app subdomain primarily used phone numbers. The incomplete registration on app still 
          led to partial data storage that could be accessed or tested on partners. 
          </ul>
