            <h3 class="headera"> Broken <span>Access Control</span></h3>
            <br>
            <ul>Broken access control refers to a critical security vulnerability where a system fails to enforce proper 
              restrictions on user actions and access permissions. This flaw allows malicious or unauthorized users to 
              gain unauthorized access to resources, data, or functionalities that they should not have. Broken access 
              control encompasses issues like horizontal privilege escalation, vertical privilege escalation, Insecure 
              Direct Object References (IDOR), insufficient session management, missing function-level access control, 
              forced browsing, and overly permissive defaults. When access controls are not correctly implemented, then 
              unauthorized users are able to bypass intended restrictions and gain access to sensitive information or 
              perform actions beyond whatâ€™s permitted., emphasizing the need for robust access control mechanisms and 
              careful security implementation to protect against these threats.</ul>

            <br>
            <ul>Security misconfigurations encompass a broad category of cybersecurity vulnerabilities that arise from 
              improperly configured systems, applications, or networks. These misconfigurations can manifest in various 
              domains, including web applications, databases, cloud services, servers, and network infrastructure. 
              Examples range from failing to disable directory listing on a web server to leaving default database 
              credentials unchanged or exposing cloud storage without proper access controls. Consequences are severe 
              and can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, data manipulation, or service disruptions. Mitigation 
              strategies involve regular configuration audits, the principle of least privilege, automated checks, timely
               software updates, and comprehensive personnel training to ensure a robust defense against these pervasive 
               threats.</ul>

            <h3 class="headera"> Broken <span>Authentication</span></h3>
            <br>
            <ul>Broken authentication constitutes a critical category of security vulnerabilities arising from inadequate
               protection of user identities and credentials within systems, applications, or networks. Weak password 
               policies, insufficient session management, credential exposure, and the absence of multi-factor authentication
                (MFA) serve as common causes. Examples include default credentials, session fixation, brute force attacks, 
                and password reset vulnerabilities, all leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. 
                Consequences encompass unauthorized entry, data leaks, identity theft, and reputation damage. Effective 
                mitigation strategies involve enforcing strong password policies, implementing MFA, securing session management,
                 encrypting credentials, implementing rate limiting and account lockouts, and conducting regular security audits
                  to identify and rectify authentication weaknesses, ensuring robust protection of user data and accounts.</ul>

            <br>
            <ul>Sensitive data exposure occurs due to inadequate encryption, weak access controls, insecure storage, 
              improper data handling, information disclosure, and insufficient data masking. Examples include unencrypted payment data, 
              misconfigured APIs, unprotected cloud storage, and plaintext passwords. Consequences encompass data 
              breaches, privacy violations, identity theft, financial losses, and reputation damage. Cryptographic 
              failures include weak encryption algorithms, improper key management, inadequate randomness, unprotected 
              key storage, and the absence of forward secrecy. Their impacts include data compromise and financial and 
              legal ramifications. Mitigation strategies involve strong encryption, rigorous access controls, secure 
              storage, data masking, proper key management, and regular security audits to safeguard sensitive data,

            <br>
            <ul>Vulnerable and outdated components pose significant security risks, often stemming from outdated or 
              obsolete software elements due to reasons like a lack of patch management, third-party dependencies, 
              legacy code, and poor dependency tracking. These components, including operating systems, frameworks, 
              libraries, and plugins, can introduce exploitable vulnerabilities, leading to potential data breaches, 
              malware attacks, financial losses, and reputation damage. Effective mitigation strategies involve 
              proactive patching, vigilant dependency management, continuous monitoring, risk assessment, proactive 
              upgrade planning, secure coding practices, and rigorous security testing, all crucial to address

            <br>
            <ul>SQL Injection (SQLi) is a malicious technique where attackers manipulate input fields of an application 
              to inject malicious SQL code into the underlying database. This unauthorized SQL code can trick the 
              application into executing unintended database queries, potentially exposing sensitive data, altering 
              database contents, or even granting unauthorized access. SQL Injection attacks are particularly dangerous 
              because they can lead to data breaches, unauthorized data retrieval or modification, and potentially 
              compromise the entire application or system. Preventative measures include input validation, parameterized 
              queries, and employing security mechanisms like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to thwart SQLi attempts, 
              protecting against this prevalent and destructive type of cyber attack.</ul>

            <h3 class="headera"> Cross Site <span>Scripting</span></h3>
            <br>
            <ul>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a widespread security vulnerability that occurs when attackers inject 
              malicious scripts, typically in the form of JavaScript, into web applications. These malicious scripts are 
              then executed within the context of a victim's browser, often without their knowledge or consent. XSS 
              attacks can be categorized into three types: stored, reflected, and DOM-based. They enable attackers to 
              steal user data, hijack sessions, deface websites, redirect users to malicious sites, or deliver malware. 
              Preventing XSS involves input validation, output encoding, implementing security headers (e.g., Content 
              Security Policy or CSP), and keeping web application frameworks and libraries up-to-date. By addressing 
              XSS vulnerabilities, organizations can safeguard their users' data and maintain the integrity of their web 
              applications.

            <h3 class="headera"> HTML <span>Injection</span></h3>
            <br>
            <ul>HTML Injection, also known as "HTML Injection Attack" or "Client-Side Injection," is a type of security 
              vulnerability where an attacker inserts malicious HTML code or tags into a web application, typically 
              through input fields or parameters. Unlike XSS, which focuses on injecting JavaScript code, HTML Injection 
              specifically manipulates HTML content within the application. While both vulnerabilities may appear 
              similar, HTML Injection does not execute scripts or interact with JavaScript. Instead, it manipulates the 
              structure and presentation of web pages, potentially leading to defacement, phishing attacks, or other 
              forms of manipulation. Prevention techniques involve input validation, output encoding, and ensuring 
              secure handling of user-generated content. While HTML Injection and XSS share some similarities in terms 
              of potential impact and mitigation strategies, they are conceptually distinct, as the former focuses 
              solely on manipulating HTML content while the latter deals with JavaScript code execution within web 
              applications.</ul>

            <br>
            <ul>Command injection is a critical security vulnerability that arises when an attacker can manipulate input 
              fields or parameters within a software application to execute arbitrary system commands on the underlying 
              server. This allows malicious actors to gain unauthorized access, control the server, exfiltrate data, or 
              perform other malicious actions. Command injection vulnerabilities typically occur in applications that 
              accept user inputs or data from untrusted sources and fail to properly validate or sanitize this input. To 
              mitigate command injection risks, developers should implement strict input validation, use parameterized 
              queries, and avoid the use of unsanitized user inputs in system commands. Regular security testing and 
              code reviews are essential for identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities, ensuring the security and 
              integrity of the application and server.</ul>

            <ul>Code injection is a critical security vulnerability that allows attackers to insert and execute 
              arbitrary code within an application, potentially compromising its functionality or security. This type 
              of vulnerability arises when untrusted inputs are not adequately validated or sanitized, allowing attackers 
              to manipulate and inject code, often in languages like PHP, Python, or JavaScript, that the application then 
              unwittingly executes. Code injection attacks can result in unauthorized access, data theft, or complete 
              control over the application. While code injection and command injection share similarities in that they 
              involve injecting code into an application, code injection is a broader category that encompasses various 
              injection types, including SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and command injection. These attacks 
              can have different targets and consequences, with command injection specifically focused on manipulating 
              system commands, while code injection exploits weaknesses in the application's code execution process itself.</ul>

            <ul>Local File Inclusion (LFI), also known as "Path Traversal" or "Directory Traversal," is a security 
              vulnerability that occurs when attackers manipulate user input in web applications to access files or 
              directories outside the intended scope. This unauthorized file access can potentially lead to the exposure 
              of sensitive data or compromise the server's file system. LFI attacks often target input validation or 
              sanitization weaknesses, and mitigation involves implementing strict controls, using whitelists for file 
              inclusions, and limiting access to sensitive directories. Regular security assessments and code reviews are 
              essential for detecting and preventing LFI vulnerabilities, ensuring the security and integrity of web 
              applications.</ul>

            <ul>Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate input in web 
              applications to include and execute external files or scripts hosted on remote servers. This type of 
              vulnerability occurs when an application improperly incorporates untrusted user input into file paths used 
              for file inclusion. RFI can have severe consequences, including unauthorized code execution, data breaches, 
              and system compromise. While RFI and LFI (Local File Inclusion) both involve file inclusion vulnerabilities, 
              they differ in the source of the included files. RFI involves external files hosted remotely, whereas LFI 
              focuses on local files hosted on the same server. RFI attacks are less common but equally dangerous. To 
              mitigate RFI, developers should validate and sanitize user inputs, use whitelists for allowable file 
              inclusions, and avoid dynamic file inclusion without proper safeguards. Regular security testing and code 
              reviews are essential to detect and address RFI vulnerabilities, safeguarding web applications against 
              external file inclusion attacks.</ul>

              to subvert the application's logic or access restricted resources, potentially causing data breaches or 
              unauthorized access. Mitigation strategies involve strict validation and sanitization of the host header, 
              utilizing security mechanisms like Content Security Policy (CSP), and configuring the web server to reject 
              invalid host headers, safeguarding against HHI threats and ensuring the security of web applications.</ul>

            <br>
            <ul>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a critical web application security vulnerability that arises when 
              an attacker can manipulate input that is used to make requests to other resources or services from the 
              server. This allows malicious actors to send requests to internal resources, potentially leading to data 
              exposure, service disruption, or even remote code execution on the server. SSRF attacks can target 
              internal systems or third-party resources accessible from the server, making them a significant threat. 
              Prevention strategies include input validation, filtering, and whitelisting to restrict the allowed 
              destinations for requests, as well as firewall rules and network segmentation to isolate sensitive 
              internal resources, mitigating the risk of SSRF and safeguarding the security and integrity of web 
              applications.</ul>

            <br>
            <ul>Business Logic Flaws, represent security weaknesses that 
              stem from improper handling of application-specific workflows and logic. These vulnerabilities occur when 
              an application fails to enforce business rules, permissions, or constraints, allowing malicious actors to 
              exploit deviations from intended behavior. Unlike traditional technical vulnerabilities, such as SQL 
              injection or XSS, business logic flaws are often unique to each application and can lead to unauthorized 
              actions, data leakage, financial fraud, or other malicious activities. Mitigation involves rigorous threat 
              modeling, careful definition and enforcement of business rules, access controls, and continuous security 
              testing and monitoring to identify and rectify these nuanced vulnerabilities, ultimately ensuring the 
              robust security of the application's core functionality.  In an online marketplace, a business logic flaw 
              might allow a user to manipulate the price of a product before purchasing it, potentially buying expensive 
              items at a fraction of their actual cost, resulting in financial losses for the seller.</ul>

            <br>
            <ul>Carriage Return Line Feed Injection (CRLF Injection or CRLFI) is a web security vulnerability that occurs 
              when an attacker can inject malicious newline characters (carriage return and line feed) into an application's 
              input fields or parameters. This manipulation can lead to various attacks, including HTTP response splitting, 
              cookie poisoning, and cross-site scripting (XSS). CRLF injection can allow attackers to control or modify HTTP 
              responses, potentially injecting malicious content, spoofing headers, or conducting session fixation attacks. 
              Preventing CRLF injection requires strict input validation and sanitization, encoding user inputs, and adhering 
              to secure coding practices. By addressing CRLF injection risks, web applications can maintain the integrity of 
              their HTTP responses and mitigate the potential for abuse by malicious actors.

            <br>
            <ul>Email Injection (Emaili) is a web security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker manipulates input 
              fields, typically in web forms or email-related features, to inject malicious email content or headers. 
              This can lead to unauthorized email sending, spamming, or phishing attacks. Email injection focuses on 
              exploiting weaknesses in email-related functionality, often by injecting newline characters (such as CR 
              and LF) and crafted email headers to deceive email systems or servers into processing emails in unintended 
              ways. While Email Injection and CRLF Injection share some similarities, as both involve manipulating input 
              to control system behavior, they are distinct in their target and impact. Email Injection specifically 
              targets email functionality, aiming to misuse or manipulate email systems, whereas CRLF Injection focuses 
              on HTTP responses and headers, often for web-based attacks like response splitting or cookie poisoning. So, 
              while there are similarities, they are different in their primary objectives and contexts.</ul>

            <ul>File Upload Vulnerability is a significant security concern in web applications, occurring when an 
              application allows users to upload files without sufficient validation and security measures. Attackers 
              exploit this vulnerability by uploading malicious files, such as scripts or malware, that can harm the 
              server or compromise user data. The consequences can be severe, ranging from remote code execution and 
              data breaches to complete system compromise. Preventing file upload vulnerabilities involves rigorous input 
              validation, allowing only safe file types, storing uploaded files in secure locations, and implementing 
              access controls and proper sanitation to ensure that uploaded files do not pose a threat. Regular security

              a password or making financial transactions, without the user's consent. Attackers exploit the user's 
              trusted session to perform actions on their behalf, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or 
              financial losses. Preventing CSRF involves using anti-CSRF tokens, validating and sanitizing user inputs, 
              and implementing security headers like the SameSite attribute for cookies. By addressing CSRF risks, web

              users into believing they are visiting a legitimate site, while they are actually being redirected to a 
              malicious one. Open redirects are often abused for phishing attacks, where attackers lure users to disclose 
              sensitive information. Preventing open redirect vulnerabilities involves validating and sanitizing redirect 
              URLs, avoiding the use of user-controlled input in redirection, and using a whitelist approach to specify 
              allowed destinations. By addressing open redirect risks, web applications can safeguard users against 
              deceptive and potentially harmful redirection attempts.</ul>

            <br>
            <ul>JSON Web Token (JWT) vulnerabilities refer to security risks associated with the use of JWTs, a popular 
              method for securely transmitting information between parties. Common JWT vulnerabilities include insecure 
              key management, insufficient token validation, and token leakage. Insecure key management occurs when keys 
              are not adequately protected, allowing attackers to forge tokens. Insufficient token validation can lead 
              to unauthorized access, as tokens are not thoroughly validated. Token leakage happens when sensitive data 
              is inadvertently stored within tokens and can be exposed. Preventing JWT vulnerabilities involves secure 
              key storage, robust token validation, and careful handling of token payloads to ensure confidentiality and 
              integrity. Regularly updating libraries and following best practices can help mitigate these risks, 
              enhancing the security of applications relying on JWTs for authentication and authorization.</ul>

            <ul>MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) or 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) Bypass is a security vulnerability 
              that occurs when attackers find ways to bypass or circumvent the additional layers of security provided by 
              MFA or 2FA systems. These systems require users to provide two or more authentication factors, typically 
              something they know (password) and something they have (a mobile device or token). Attackers may attempt 
              to compromise the second factor, such as by stealing or duplicating a hardware token or using social 
              engineering to gain access to the user's mobile device. MFA or 2FA bypass undermines the security benefits 
              of these authentication methods, potentially allowing unauthorized access to accounts or systems. 
              Preventing MFA or 2FA bypass involves securing both authentication factors, educating users about security 
              risks, and implementing additional measures like biometric authentication or behavioral analysis. captcha 
            bypass can be part of this.</ul>
